# 2. Tools

## Burp Suite

### Built-In Browser
Automatically stores requests without the intercept button being activated

### Other Browsers
Foxy Proxy
* Easy switch on and off for using a proxy

### Proxy
"Intercept is On"
* Captures traffic before forwarding to browser 
"Intercept is Off"
* Will still capture requests sent in the "HTTP History" tab 
#### Options Tab
* Can edit the port which Burp is bound to 
* Match and Replace – modify requests and responses based on enabled rules 
> Can be used to mimic mobile devices by modifying the request header 

### Intruder
* Used to modify responses to the website (I.e. use wordlists to test username and password requests in a POST request).  
* Can use this tool to manipulate any request with input data. 
* Using the § character (one to start, and another to end) 
> Burp will automatically add this when sending a request from Intercept 
* Capture requests using Proxy/Intercept, then right-click and "Send to Intruder" 
#### Payloads Tab
* Can upload wordlists to use as the payload (I.e. password list)

* After starting the attack, pay attention the length of the response. This will show a difference and you can find anomalies 

### Repeater
* Used to capture and modify your web requests and view the responses on the right side 
* Deconding Text 
> Ctrl+Shift+U 

## nmap
Usage
```bash
sudo nmap -p80 -sV 192.168.1.15
```

### nmap Scripts
Location
```bash
/usr/share/nmap/scripts 
```
Show all HTTP Nmap Scripts 
```bash
ls –lsaht /usr/share/nmap/scripts |grep -I 'http' 
```
Running scripts 
```bash
nmap –p80 –script=http-enum 172.16.80.1 
```
Running scripts with different arguments 
* Http-methods – use to check which methods are allowed on particular directories 
```bash
nmap –p80 --script=http-methods --script-args http-methods.url-path='/wp-includes/' 192.168.1.5 
```
Specially Selected NSE Scripts 
```bash
--script=http-methods,http-ls,http-robots.txt,http-cookie-flags,http-cors 
```

## Wordlists
### Seclists
Install
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y seclists
```
Check Seclists
```bash
ls -lsa /usr/share/seclists/
```
Additional password wordlist `rockyou.txt`
```bash
/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
### Creating Custom Wordlists
Use cewl to create wordlists from a provided URL
```bash
sudo cewl -d 2 -m 5 -w ourWordlist.txt www.MegaCorpOne.com
```

## Gobuster
Uses a wordlist to find directories and files on a server. Good for web server enumeration.
Install
```bash
sudo apt install -y gobuster
```
Usage for Discovering Endpoints
```bash
gobuster dir -u $URL -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -t 5 -b 301
```
Usage for Subdomain Discovery
```bash
gobuster dns -d megacorpone.com -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -t 30
```

## Wfuzz
Automated tool to perform input testing
### File Discovery
```bash
wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-files.txt --hc 301,404,403 "http://website:80/FUZZ"
```
> -c - display color output
> -z file - specify the input source
> --hc - avoid non-existen and erroneous responses

### Directory Discovery
```bash
wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt --hc 404,403,301 "http://offsecwp:80/FUZZ/"
```

### Parameter Discovery
```bash
wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt --hc 404,301 "http://offsecwp:80/index.php?FUZZ=data"
```

### Parameter Values
Once a parameter is discovered, you can fuzz the value!
```bash
wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/seclists/Usernames/cirt-default-usernames.txt --hc 404 "http://offsecwp:80/index.php?fpv=FUZZ"
```
> Example above assumes the "fpv" parameter has already been discovered.
> In the examples we've explored, it's important to note that we have only provided the FUZZ keyword. If we were interested in fuzzing multiple parameters, we could include that parameter in our endpoint and supply the FUZ2Z keyword where we wish to fuzz a second value.

### Fuzzing POST Data
Capture the POST via Burp Suite and then use wfuzz to fuzz the data
```bash
wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords-100000.txt --hc 404 -d "log=admin&pwd=FUZZ" http://offsecwp:80/wp-login.php
```
> `"log=admin&pwd=FUZZ"` is from the POST request in Burp
> `--hc` switch ignores that response type
> `--hh` can be used to ignore responses with a specific # of characters

## Hakrawler
Web Crawler
* Difference between directory busting tool and crawling tool
    * Directory busting - uses a worlist to check for webpages
    * Crawling tool - travel across endpoints in the UI, following links, etc.
Install
```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt-get install -y hakrawler
```
Usage
```bash
echo "https://somewebsite.com/" > urls.txt
cat urls.txt | ./hakrawler
```
> This pipes the website into hakrawler and then the same file can be catted to see the results
