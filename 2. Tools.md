## Burp Suite

### Built-In Browser
Automatically stores requests without the intercept button being activated

### Other Browsers
Foxy Proxy
* Easy switch on and off for using a proxy

### Proxy
"Intercept is On"
* Captures traffic before forwarding to browser 
"Intercept is Off"
* Will still capture requests sent in the "HTTP History" tab 
#### Options Tab
* Can edit the port which Burp is bound to 
* Match and Replace – modify requests and responses based on enabled rules 
> Can be used to mimic mobile devices by modifying the request header 

### Intruder
* Used to modify responses to the website (I.e. use wordlists to test username and password requests in a POST request).  
* Can use this tool to manipulate any request with input data. 
* Using the § character (one to start, and another to end) 
> Burp will automatically add this when sending a request from Intercept 
* Capture requests using Proxy/Intercept, then right-click and "Send to Intruder" 
#### Payloads Tab
* Can upload wordlists to use as the payload (I.e. password list)

* After starting the attack, pay attention the length of the response. This will show a difference and you can find anomalies 

### Repeater
* Used to capture and modify your web requests and view the responses on the right side 
* Deconding Text 
> Ctrl+Shift+U
